              question="Is ozone a greenhouse gas?"
              answer="Ozone is technically a greenhouse gas, but ozone is helpful or harmful depending on where it is found in the earth's atmosphere. Ozone occurs naturally at higher elevations in the atmosphere (the stratosphere) where it forms a layer that blocks ultraviolet (UV) light, which is harmful to plant and animal life, from reaching the earthâ€™s surface. The protective benefit of stratospheric ozone outweighs its contribution to the greenhouse effect and to global warming. However, at lower elevations of the atmosphere (the troposphere), ozone is harmful to human health.

There are human-made industrial chemicals that break down ozone in the stratosphere and create holes in the ozone layer. The United States and countries all around the world ban and control production and use of several of these industrial gases under the Montreal Protocol. In the United States, emissions of air pollutants that result in ozone formation in the troposphere, or ground-level ozone, are regulated under the Clean Air Act."

            <FAQItem
              question="What are the greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions factors for fuels and electricity?"
              answer="The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes emission factors (or coefficients) for the amounts of certain gases that are released when fuels are burned and for when electricity is generated. EIA publishes emission factors for energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are CO2 emissions related to energy consumption, and for U.S. electricity generation, as well as for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions related to U.S. electricity generation.

SO2 and NOx are criteria pollutants regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments. They are not greenhouse gases. The NOx emissions and emissions factors published by EIA do not include emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a greenhouse gas (GHG). The only GHG emissions estimates and GHG emissions factors that EIA publishes are for energy-related CO2 emissions.

            <FAQItem
              question="Why do carbon dioxide emissions weigh more than the original fuel?"
              answer="The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced from burning a fuel weighs more than the amount of the fuel itself. During complete combustion, each carbon atom in the fuel combines with two oxygen atoms in the air to make CO2. The addition of two oxygen atoms to each carbon atom forms CO2, which has an atomic weight of 44â€”about 3.6667 times the atomic weight of the carbon, which is 12.

For example, subbituminous coal is, on average, 51% carbon, so the carbon in a short ton (2,000 pounds) of subbituminous coal weighs 1,020 pounds. The CO2 emissions from burning a short ton of subbituminous coal weigh approximately 3,740 pounds, or about 3.67 times the weight of the carbon in a short ton of subbituminous coal and 1.87 times the weight of a short ton of subbituminous coal."

              question="Does have historical gasoline prices for each state?"
              answer="Yes, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes historical gasoline price data. Unless otherwise indicated, the prices that EIA publishes are nominal prices.

Retail gasoline prices, including taxes, are available for selected cities and states dating back to 2000. Weekly prices, average monthly prices, and average annual prices by grade and formulation are available.

The State Energy Data System (SEDS) contains estimates for average annual gasoline prices for each state dating back to 1970. The prices are in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu). The prices include federal and state gasoline taxes, but they exclude local taxes.

To obtain the historical prices from the SEDS data, use the CSV file for All Statesâ€”Prices. In the file, the code for gasoline prices for the transportation sector, in $/MMBtu, is: State Abbreviation (in column A) and MGACD (in column B). For example, the code for Alaska is AKâ€”MGACD. Those prices, in $/MMBtu, can be converted to approximate dollars per gallon using the heat contents in Table A3 Petroleum consumption and fuel ethanol. There are 42 U.S. gallons in a barrel.

Historical average monthly and annual prices for all states, from retail outlets, excluding taxes, by grade and formulation (and by other sales types) are available from 1983 to 2011. Data collection for the price series was suspended in 2011. Historical federal and state taxes on motor vehicle fuels are published in the Motor Fuels sections of the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s annual Highway Statistics Series.

              question="Does the world have enough oil to meet our future needs?"
              answer="According to the U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) International Energy Outlook 2023 (IEO2023), the global supply of crude oil, other liquid hydrocarbons, and biofuels is expected to be adequate to meet the world's demand for liquid fuels through 2050. There is substantial uncertainty about the levels of future liquid fuels supply and demand. The IEO2023 projections reflect some of this uncertainty in a Reference case, High and Low Economic Growth cases, High and Low Oil Price cases, and High and Low-Zero Carbon Technology Growth cases in its projections. The oil resources currently in the earth's crust, in combination with expected production of other liquid fuels, are estimated to be sufficient to meet total world demand for liquid fuels in all cases of the IEO2023.

An often cited, but misleading, measurement of future resource availability is the reserves-to-production ratio, which is calculated by dividing the volume of total proved reserves by the volume of current annual consumption. Proved reserves are an accounting concept that is based on known projects, and it is not an appropriate measure for judging total resource availability in the long term. Over time, global reserves will likely increase as new technologies increase production at existing fields and as new projects are developed"

              question="What types and amounts of energy are produced in each state?"
              answer="You can access the most recent available data on the types and amounts of energy produced in each state as follows:

Coal, crude oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, biofuels (fuel ethanol and biodiesel), and wood and wood waste (for energy) annual production from 1960 to most recent year available in the State Energy Data System (SEDS). There are two options for finding the state-level production data for each state from the main SEDS page:
Scroll down the main SEDS page to find the link at lower left for 1960-20?? estimates (where ?? is the most recent year available), and on that page scroll down to find the Production section.
At the upper left of the main SEDS page, click on the Change State/Territory field, which is above the Overview, Data, and Analysis tabs. Select a state and on the resulting page and scroll over the Data tab. In the drop-down menu, select a data period under Energy Estimates (SEDS). Scroll down the resulting page and select the Production bar to access files with data on the types and amounts of energy produced.
Coalâ€”weekly, quarterly, and annual
Crude oilâ€”monthly and annual
Natural gasâ€”monthly and annual
Natural gas plant liquidsâ€”monthly and annual
Electricityâ€”generation by fuel/energy source:
Most recent available month and year-to-date (Chapter 1)
Historical monthly generation back to 2001 (Excel)
Annual data back to 1990 (Excel)
State Electricity Profiles (Annual data back to 1990. In each Profile, see Table 5. Electric power industry generation by primary energy source)
The location of coal mines, electric power plants, and oil and natural gas fields and wells in each state are available in an interactive map. See the short instructional video on how to use the interactive map."

              question="When was the last refinery built in the United States?"
              answer="As of January 1, 2023, there were 129 operable petroleum refineries in the United States.

The newest refinery in the United States is the Texas International Terminals 45,000 b/cd refinery in Channelview, Texas, which started operating operating in February 2022.

However, the newest refinery with significant downstream unit capacity is Marathon's facility in Garyville, Louisiana. That facility came online in 1977 with an initial atmospheric distillation unit capacity of 200,000 b/cd, and as of January 1, 2023, it had a capacity of 596,000 b/cd.

Capacity has also been added to existing refineries through upgrades or new construction. Some recent examples of large increases include:

In 2012, Motiva upgraded its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, making it the largest U.S. refinery, with a capacity of 626,000 b/cd as of January 1, 2023.
In 2015, Valero expanded its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery after previous expansions, bringing its capacity as of January 1, 2023, to 290,000 b/cd."

              question="How many gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel are made from one barrel of oil?"
              answer="Petroleum refineries in the United States produce about 19 to 20 gallons of motor gasoline and 11 to 12 gallons of ultra-low sulfur distillate fuel oil (most of which is sold as diesel fuel and in several states as heating oil) from one 42-gallon barrel of crude oil. Many other petroleum products are also refined from crude oil. Refinery yields of individual products vary from month to month as refiners focus operations to meet demand for different products and as they work to maximize profits."
